# Jetpack Compose with MVVM
```
Jetpack Compose is a modern UI toolkit introduced by Google for building native Android user interfaces. 
It simplifies and accelerates UI development by leveraging the power of Kotlin and a declarative programming model.
```

# Basic Functions
```
Jetpack Compose introduces several essential functions to help developers build UIs efficiently:
```
- **Composable Function** : Marked with the @Composable annotation, these functions define the UI components programmatically.
- **Preview Function** : Annotated with @Preview, this function allows developers to preview their composable functions within the IDE without running the app on an emulator.
- **Column and Row Functions** : These functions stack UI elements vertically and horizontally, respectively.
- **Box** : A widget that positions elements relative to its edges, allowing for overlapping elements.
- **Spacer** : Provides spacing between views by specifying height and width.
- **Vertical Scroll** : Enables vertical scrolling behavior for views that exceed the screen height.
- **Padding** : Adds extra white space around specific views.
- **Lazy List** : Equivalent to a RecyclerView, it efficiently renders only the visible elements on the screen.
